Exelis’ IDL is a high-level programing language used for data analysis and visualization. http://exelisvis.com.  It appears to have a strong following in the geosciences and related elements of NOAA.

The GCOOS IDL utility package provides routines that call 
52N SOS implementations of GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor and GetObservation.

The XML SOS responses are converted into IDL hashes/lists using Ed Shaya’s (eshaya@umd.edu) read_xml8.pro, xml2idl8.pro and str_clean.pro routings.https://github.com/Small-Bodies-Node/pds4-idl/

These example codes are meant to be taken and modified to suit your purposes.
